# AI-Attack
I created a web page to discuss or remind people about the threat that AI poses to us. The page is divided into third sections, one is to take you back to the past two years AI moral disputes and threats to human survival events, click on the picture can be linked to related events. The second section looks at how people respond to and feel about the topic. Click on the corresponding color and you'll hear sounds; scary, white noise, or calm and comfortable. The third is a video cut from kurosawa akira's film. The purpose of this page is to try to "Wake up"people to think about whether AI will bring about a crisis.
